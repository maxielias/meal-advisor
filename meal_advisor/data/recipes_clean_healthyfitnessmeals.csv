Sirloin tip and flank steak are the best cuts of beef for making shawarma.
If you don’t have a grill, you can also make this in a cast-iron pan.
Cut the steak to no thinner than 1/2 inch so that it remains juicy.
Avoid marinating for too long. 30 minutes is the perfect amount of time for marinating beef shawarma. Anything longer than 2 hours will cause the beef to break down.
You can make it with chicken if you like, but we do have a chicken shawarma recipe you can check out.
Serve in a pita wrap, over salad, or over a rice bowl.

Use small to medium carrots and ideally buy a pack of similar-sized ones, so they all cook at the same rate. Carrots that are too small won’t have time to caramelize and if they are too big they will take too long to roast.
Make sure to peel and trim the edges of the carrots.
For the best maple flavor use a dark (grade A) pure maple syrup.
If you don’t like maple syrup, you can use agave syrup.
Add some red chili flakes for an added kick!
You can check how tender they are with a toothpick or a fork. Some may like this a bit crunchy. We love them super soft and tender.

You may use any other cucumber
We prefer that you use kalamata olives for the best possible flavor
Instead of chicken breast, you can use boneless chicken thighs
Use avocado or olive oil
Romaine lettuce is preferred but you may use any of your favorite greens
If you plan on making this ahead, prep and cut the veggies and set aside. Do not mix the salad with the dressing. Mix and store the dressing separately.

To be sure you have gluten-free oatmeal bars, make sure you buy gluten-free oats.
For extra moisture, add applesauce to the oat bars.
Instead of peanut butter, use cashew or almond butter. You can even try sunflower butter if there is a nut allergy.
Use vanilla protein powder instead of chocolate powder for fewer chocolate flavors. For a vegan option, use plant-based protein powder.
Instead of dark chocolate chips, switch things up with white chocolate, peanut butter, or butterscotch chips. Use dairy-free for a vegan option
In place of the peanuts, roasted almonds or cashews can be used.
For extra nutty flavors, sprinkle some unsweetened shredded coconut in the oat mixture and on top before baking.
If you do not want to mix the ingredients by hand, then you can mix things in a food processor.
Store the leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for four days. The bars will last longer stored in the refrigerator for up to one week.
Freeze the bars by cutting them into squares and freezing them in a freezer-safe bag for three months.
Add rich aromatic spices to these soft baked bars such as cinnamon or nutmeg.

Use a preheated oven.
To check doneness, use a knife inserted in the center, if it comes out clean, the Cranberry Orange Bread is ready.
This bread was made without orange juice. If you would like to add some, you may add about 1/2 a cup but you would have to add another 1/4 cup of oat or gluten-free flour.
You can whip up a couple of these as easily as one, so feel free to double the ingredients. One for you and one for a friend (or two for you!).
Use a greased loaf pan.
If you like, add some chopped nuts. Nuts are a wonderful addition and compliment the flavors of the bread beautifully.
 If using frozen cranberries, you do not need to thaw them.
Invest in an oven thermometer. If you don’t have one already, they are great for baking! Most ovens vary in temperature, an inexpensive oven thermometer is a great way to bake your loaf perfectly

Leeks: Choose leeks that have at least 2-3 inches of clean, white bottom stalks. The tops should be dark green and tightly rolled, not wimpy or soggy looking.
Yukon gold potatoes: These are our favorite potatoes for this recipe since they soften nicely. You can substitute with any other yellow-skinned potato, red potatoes, or sweet potatoes.
Asparagus: Choose asparagus stalks that are firm and stand up straight. We prefer medium width asparagus stalks. Avoid very thick stalks as they tend to be woodier.
Greek yogurt: You can leave this out for a dairy-free or vegan option. You can also substitute with a dash of heavy cream on each bowl instead.
Pine nuts: These also go by pinoli or pignoli. For optional extra flavor, toast them in a dry skillet until golden brown before serving.
Make sure to cook the leeks, potatoes, and asparagus until very tender so that it easily purees with the immersion blender. This will prevent stringy soup.
Storage: Cool completely, then store in an air-tight container in the fridge for 3-5 days. 
Freezing: Cool completely, then store in an air-tight container and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge or at room temperature, then reheat it on the stove or in the microwave.

Melt your chocolate in the microwave, in 20 sec increments, this stops the chocolate from burning.
You want to use ripe avocados for these Vegan Truffles.
If the avocado yields to firm gentle pressure you know it’s ripe. Ripe avocados may have a darker color but color can vary so it is best to go by feel as well.
If you have one, use a melon baller to scoop chocolate into balls.
You can use vegan chocolate bars instead of chips, just make sure to break them up and weigh them.
You only want the avocado meat, not the skins!
Have fun with rolling the truffles in different toppings.

If using wooden skewers, allow them to soak for 30 mins to avoid them burning.
Doubling the skewers when threading, makes life easier! This prevents the salmon from flipping around the stick while turning.

Add some red pepper flakes for a spicy kick.
Brush the grill with some oil before cooking, to avoid tearing the Lemon Salmon Skewers.
When picking out a salmon fillet for this recipe, look for fillets that are thicker have an even thickness throughout. This means the skewered salmon pieces are similar in size and will cook evenly.

Add greens. If you’re looking to get more greens in your diet, try adding a handful or two of baby spinach or kale leaves. It will turn the smoothie a different color, but you won’t be able to taste the greens.
Different fruit. Feel free to sub the blueberries for strawberries, raspberries, mango, cherries, pineapple, peaches, or any other favorite. Just be sure to use frozen fruit for the best results.

chicken: we love using chicken breasts since they are leaner but if you are a fan of chicken thighs and you aren’t counting macros, you can use boneless chicken thighs.
broth: the recipe is that of chicken so we used chicken broth. you may use vegetable broth.
please use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder

Baby new potatoes: New potatoes don’t refer to a specific variety, but just mean young potatoes. They hold their shape well and have a creamy texture after cooking. Some options for new potatoes are baby red potatoes, baby Yukon golds, or baby yellow potatoes.
Greek yogurt: We suggest using full fat yogurt for the most creamy texture.
Dijon mustard: You can substitute with yellow mustard or spicy brown mustard, but each one will have a different flavor. Choose your favorite.
Shallots: If you don’t have shallots, substitute with sweet onion or red onion.
Choosing potatoes: Try to choose small, evenly sized potatoes. This will help them cook evenly.
Cooking tip: After the water comes to a boil, simmer the potatoes instead of boiling. This also helps them cook more evenly.

Cream cheese: The cream cheese is much easier to mix with the other grape salad dressing ingredients if it’s left at room temperature to warm up for about an hour before cooking. If you forget to take it out, I recommend using a blender or food processor to mix up the dressing instead of a spoon or whisk.
Make it vegan: Use dairy-free Greek-style yogurt and cream cheese to make this grape salad recipe vegan friendly. It tastes great this way too!
Add different nuts: Pecans are great on top of this recipe or even candied pecans or walnuts.
Toast the nuts: I love toasted nuts! To toast, just add them to a non-stick pan over medium heat on the stove and cook them until they turn a little darker and are fragrant. Allow the toasted nuts to cool before adding them to this grape salad recipe.

Slice evenly cut fries, so they all cook at the same rate, no burning and no underdone fries here!
Don’t overcrowd the fries. Make sure they are spread evenly on a single layer so they all cook evenly. 
Line the baking tray with parchment paper to prevent sticking. 
If you want these sweet potato fries extra crispy you can coat them with about 2 teaspoons. But they come out just as good without!
For further crispiness swap olive oil for ghee.
If you have time, soak your uncooked sweet potato fries in cold water for 30 mins up to overnight. This removes excess starch and makes them even more crispy.
If you can wait - allow to cool for 5 mins, this will make them crispier!
For a spicy kick, add some chili flakes after baking.

Make sure your butter and eggs are at room temp. This means they'll incorporate into the dough better.
You can swap the butter out for ghee.
If the cookies don’t drop into cookie shapes in the oven within the first 5 minutes, you can easily press them down with fork midway through cooking.
 If you are not using 100% pure erythritol, your cookies will not flatten completely.
Ideally use a good quality, grass-fed, butter. Grass-fed butter contains up to 6 times more CLA which can help your body burn fat properly.
Use a wire rack to help the cookies cool properly, so they won't have a soggy base.
You can swap the chocolate chips for walnuts if you like.
You can omit the sea salt if you wish, but it does add a lovely flavor profile.
These Keto Cookies are done when the edges are starting to brown. They will still be lovely and soft on the inside!
If you want crispier Keto Cookies, bake them for a little bit longer. Remove from the oven when the edges go a little darker brown.

Use a preheated waffle iron.
Use room temperature eggs! They turn out lighter and fluffier if you do
Try not to overfill the waffle iron, it's best to slightly under-fill it because the batter will spread out when the waffle iron is closed.
Don't open the waffle iron until it's ready! Opening the waffle iron will lower the temperature and extend the cooking time.
If you have a non-stick waffle iron, use a silicone or wooden utensil, so it won't scratch the surface.
Avoid violent overmixing of the batter. The paleo waffle batter should be smooth but not mixed too hard, as this results in chewier/less fluffy waffles.
You can reheat the waffles in the toaster or the microwave.

Use a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Even though I use coconut oil, this does not taste of coconuts. If you like coconuts, add some shavings.
Allow the granola to cool before adding the chocolate chips.
Press down the pre-cooked granola with a spatula to create a uniform layer. This helps with the formation of lovely, crunchy little clumps!
As the granola cools on the baking sheet, it continues to form clusters and hardens just a bit, so be sure not to wait until your granola has really browned to pull it out of the oven.

If your avocado has a small pit, use a spoon to remove some of the avocado meat and make room for the egg.
You’ll need to keep the avocado upright, so the egg stays in. You can place them in ramekins to make it easier.
If you don’t have a ramekin, no problem! You can lean the avocados next to each, supporting them.
Use a preheated oven.
When cracking the eggs into the avocado, be careful not to break the yolk.
For a spicy kick, sprinkle on some crushed red chili flakes.
In place of Parmesan, you can tip with cheddar or crumbled feta
Top with chopped fresh tomato, for a pop of freshness.
Try looking for the larger avocados since they work better for this recipe. They have a larger pit and thus larger space for eggs.

Go for pumpkin puree, not pumpkin pie filling. Pumpkin pie filling is often loaded with additives and gives the muffins the wrong flavor.
Make sure your ingredients are up to room temp before mixing.
You can use coconut sugar or low-calorie sweetener.
When combining your wet and dry ingredients don’t overmix, otherwise, the batter will make tough muffins.
You can use a cookie scoop to evenly portion the batter into the molds.
Make sure you line the muffin pan with paper liners or grease the muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray.
Don’t over-bake the muffins. Take these Healthy Pumpkin Muffins out when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

To be sure you have gluten-free oatmeal bars, make sure you buy gluten-free oats.
For extra moisture, add applesauce to the oat bars.
Instead of peanut butter, use cashew or almond butter. You can even try sunflower butter if there is a nut allergy.
Use vanilla protein powder instead of chocolate powder for fewer chocolate flavors. For a vegan option, use plant-based protein powder.
Instead of dark chocolate chips, switch things up with white chocolate, peanut butter, or butterscotch chips. Use dairy-free for a vegan option
In place of the peanuts, roasted almonds or cashews can be used.
For extra nutty flavors, sprinkle some unsweetened shredded coconut in the oat mixture and on top before baking.
If you do not want to mix the ingredients by hand, then you can mix things in a food processor.
Store the leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for four days. The bars will last longer stored in the refrigerator for up to one week.
Freeze the bars by cutting them into squares and freezing them in a freezer-safe bag for three months.
Add rich aromatic spices to these soft baked bars such as cinnamon or nutmeg.
Dried fruit such as cranberries, raisins, dates, etc. will work great for this recipe!

As you start to measure out the ingredients, grab two bowls and measure out the dry ingredients in one bowl then measure out the wet ingredients in another bowl.  Then it will be simple to add wet and dry ingredients together and mix.
Make sure all of your wet ingredients are at room temperature.
If you don’t have almond flour you can use whole wheat instead if you don’t care for making these gluten-free. If you need this Gluten-free then just add more Gluten-free flour. 
Whole wheat pastry flour yields extra light and fluffy muffins that are delicate until cooled. 
Make sure to use pumpkin puree and not pumpkin pie filling. Pumpkin pie filling has a completely different flavor. 
Use baking soda not baking powder.

If the avocado yields to firm gentle pressure you know it’s ripe. Ripe avocados may have a darker color but color can vary so it is best to go by feel as well.
If you have one, use a melon baller to scoop chocolate into balls.

Don’t forget to reserve pasta water. The starchy water helps the flavors stick to pasta and make things blend in much better. If you do forget, you will have to improvise.
Do not overcook the chicken so it doesn’t feel dry and rubbery.
If you cant find Herbs de Provence, don’t fret, use equal amounts of rosemary, thyme, and oregano.
If you prefer not to use chicken, you can use any other protein. Shrimp would be another great option.
You can make this pasts dish much healthier by using whole-grain pasta, lentil pasta, or zome zucchini noodles.
Fresh spinach is prefered. But you may use frozen if you have to. If you go with frozen, make sure you thaw first and drain.

Protein: Instead of chicken, try the grilled steak, salmon, or shrimp.
Greens: Swap out the baby spinach for romaine or a mixed greens blend. Kale or arugula will also work just fine.
Vegetables: You can absolutely add other vegetables to the mix, some suggestions included grilled veggies such as asparagus, zucchini, or bell peppers. Marinated artichoke hearts or black olives are also a nice addition.
Cheese: A sprinkle of cheese on top is so tasty. We recommend shredded Mexican cheese or cheddar.

Enjoy! ","
Use extra virgin if possible. I prefer using olive oil over other types of oils for this recipe. There are so many health benefits of olive oil. They are rich in healthy Monounsaturated Fats and high in antioxidants.
It would be best if you use fresh lemons for this Greek pasta salad dressing. Nothing beats the robust flavors of fresh lemons. If you happen to only have bottled lemon juice then use bottled lemon juice. I highly recommend using fresh lemon juice.
You can use lime if you have that instead, it gives you more of a tang.
If you don’t have red wine vinegar you have a few other options you can use. You may try to substitute with white wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar, or balsamic vinegar. Vinegar is essential for traditional greek dressing.
Use dried or fresh herbs. Traditional Greek salad dressing calls for oregano.
Garlic will bring out the flavor of the dressing. If you don’t have any fresh garlic you can about 1 teaspoon garlic powder.
Use salt and pepper sparingly. You can either add some to the dressing say about 1/2 a teaspoon each and then taste the salad later to see if it needs more salt and pepper and go ahead and adjust accordingly.
Swap the pasta for something like spinach tortellini, to make it a Greek Tortellini Salad.
Add a protein to make it even heartier, grilled chicken works great.

You can use fresh or frozen blueberries in this gluten-free blueberry muffin recipe.
 Use cupcake liners to keep the muffins from sticking to the pan. If you don't have cupcake liners make sure you grease the inside of the muffin molds.
Always start with the lowest cooking time recommended and watch for doneness from there.
Allow the muffins to cool in the pan for 2-5 minutes and then place the muffins on a cooling rack. This helps your muffins from getting, what is called in baking circles, “soggy bottoms”!

Frozen peas and carrots: You can also add in fresh peas and carrots, or other vegetables like zucchini, yellow squash, bamboo shoots, snap peas, broccoli, and cauliflower, baby corn, etc.
The best way to make shrimp fried rice is to use cooked and cooled long-grain rice. Warm rice or glutinous short rice will make this recipe mushy! The perfect way to use up some of your leftover rice.
Scrambling the eggs away from the vegetables is essential. They firm up the best when they are not immediately mixed in with the other ingredients.
Use pre-minced fresh garlic and ginger to make this recipe even easier!
Use up any leftover vegetables in the fridge. This is a delicious way to clear out the fridge before a grocery shop.
Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 3 days.
This is great for meal prep!

Use a preheated oven.
Make sure your egg is up to room temp.
Medium-sized berries work best, they hold their shape and don’t overwhelm any individual scone.
If using frozen blueberries, no need to defrost them.
Don’t overwork the dough, as this can leave you with a tougher texture.
Scones are best served warm.
If you like, you can boost the flavor of the almond flour with some almond extract.

Use raw shrimp instead of cooked shrimp. The texture and flavor will be so much better.
You may use any other oil instead of olive oil.
Peas: if you don’t like peas, use other veggies of choice. You may also skip it completely.
yogurt: we used plain yogurt instead of mayonnaise. Sour cream will also work. For a non-dairy option, you can use dairy-free yogurt.
It is best to use fresh garlic cloves instead of garlic powder.

Use a preheated waffle iron.
Use room temperature eggs! They turn out lighter and fluffier if you do
Try not to overfill the waffle iron, it's best to slightly under-fill it because the batter will spread out when the waffle iron is closed.
Don't open the waffle iron until it's ready! Opening the waffle iron will lower the temperature and extend the cooking time.
If you have a non-stick waffle iron, use a silicone or wooden utensil, so it won't scratch the surface.
Avoid violent overmixing of the batter. The paleo waffle batter should be smooth but not mixed too hard, as this results in chewier/less fluffy waffles.
You can reheat the waffles in the toaster or the microwave.
For the meal prep containers, peel the eggs in advance if you like.

Cream cheese: The cream cheese is much easier to mix with the other grape salad dressing ingredients if it’s left at room temperature to warm up for about an hour before cooking.

Make it vegan: Use dairy-free Greek-style yogurt and cream cheese to make this grape salad recipe vegan friendly. It tastes great this way too!
Add different nuts: Pecans are great on top of this recipe or even candied pecans or walnuts.
Toast the nuts: I love toasted nuts! To toast, just add them to a non-stick pan over medium heat on the stove and cook them until they turn a little darker and are fragrant. Allow the toasted nuts to cool before adding them to this grape salad recipe.

Seving size: 2 skewers
Use Lean ground chicken if possible. You may use ground turkey if you prefer but the taste and texture will change slightly since the turkey tends to be more on the dry side.
Don’t like chicken or turkey, make beef kafta instead. Here is our popular beef kafta recipe you can try instead.
Use fresh ingredients where possible. It is important to use fresh parsley as that’s what brings out the kafta flavor. You may use dried mint if you cant get your hands on fresh mint.
You can easily sub the whole wheat bread for breadcrumbs. If your ground chicken is not too lean then you can cut back on the breadcrumbs and use only half the amount.
Egg and breadcrumbs are important ingredients to act as binders so the whole kebab doesn’t fall apart off the skewer are you grill them.
Wet your hands with water or oil when adding the chicken kafta to the skewers. This is because it might be a bit sticky and it just makes things easier.
Do place the chicken kafta in the fridge for a few minutes before adding to the skewers. It makes everything bind together so well.

Honey: For a vegan option, substitute the honey for maple syrup or agave nectar.
Sesame oil is needed for the best flavor. If not, you can use peanut oil or sunflower oil.
If using English cucumbers, you do not have to peel the cucumber. The skin is thin enough and won’t be an issue.

(or over medium to lose for 20 minutes )Serve the meat sauce with your favorite cooked pasta. This sauce can be refrigerated for up to 5 days or frozen for 4-6 months. ","
Tomatoes: Use both crushed and chopped tomatoes to add texture to the sauce. 
Garlic: We recommend using freshly chopped garlic for the best flavor, but you can also use jarred minced garlic if needed. Garlic powder does not make a good substitute since it adds bitterness to the sauce. 
Onion: Yellow onions are fantastic in this recipe, but Walla Walla or Vidalia onions make great substitutes. 
Oil: Olive oil adds great flavor to this sauce, but you can also use avocado oil or butter for keto. 
Don't overcook the garlic. It burns easily and will give the sauce a bitter taste. 
Storing: Store in a container in the fridge for up to five days. Freeze for up to 4-6 months.
Slow cooker instructions: Follow the instructions until the meat is cooked and the tomatoes and other seasonings are added. Transfer sauce to the slow cooker and cook on low for 3-5 hours, stirring occasionally. Serve over cooked pasta.

Sweeten it up. This blueberry smoothie should be perfectly sweet, but if you’d like it sweeter you can add a 1/2 tablespoon of honey, pure maple syrup, a bit of stevia, or a Medjool date.
Add greens. If you’re looking to get more greens in your diet, try adding a handful or two of baby spinach or kale leaves. It will turn the smoothie a different color, but you won’t be able to taste the greens.
Different fruit. Feel free to sub the blueberries for strawberries, raspberries, mango, cherries, pineapple, peaches, or any other favorite. Just be sure to use frozen fruit for the best results.
Add an extra boost of nutrition. Try adding in a serving of protein powder, flax seed, hemp seeds, or oats.

Use Raw Shrimp rather than cooked shrimp. You can use frozen raw shrimps 
Allow the Shrimps to thaw completely before cooking.
Drain shrimp and pat dry with a paper towel
Honey: You may sub this with maple syrup if necessary
Oil: Any other cooking oil will work. 
We love using whole grain mustard. If you don’t have this, you may use a total of 1/4 cup Dijon mustard.
Instead of shrimps, try it with chicken breasts.
Potatoes. We love using baby potatoes and especially love the Little Potato Company Creamer potatoes.

You can prep these 30 mins in advance or overnight.
Adding almond butter or peanut butter makes these oats even creamier and gives a nutty/savory twist to the flavor.
Do not use quick oats as they will get too soggy when soaked with milk. Also, do not use steel-cut oats because they won’t soften enough to eat with milk. Stick with plain old fashioned oats for the best results.
If you prefer a looser consistency to your overnight oatmeal recipe, add a little more milk.
Add your toppings just before serving. Toppings can not only prevent the soaking process from happening but throw off the liquid to oat ratio, leaving you with soggy oats!
To make gluten-free use gluten-free oats.
To make dairy-free use a dairy-free milk option, almond milk works great.

You may use pre-cooked shrimp or raw shrimps 
If using pre-cooked, you do not need to soak the shrimps in the lemon and lime juice for 15 minutes. Just about 5 minutes will do.
If using raw shrimps, you must time the soak time for 15 minutes to allow it to cook in the acidity of the lemon and lime juice.
Chop your onions well! You just want a hint of spicy raw onion, not a mouthful of it. Using a mandoline to thinly slice the red onion is great.
Don’t skimp on the cilantro. Just like guacamole, ceviche needs a good helping of cilantro to balance the flavors.
Add a spicy kick. Adding a few drops of Tabasco (or any other favorite hot sauce) will give your ceviche just the right amount of kick. It also adds flavor from the vinegar and spices.
Removing the ribs and seeds from your jalapeno will significantly reduce the heat of the pepper. If you prefer spicy food, keep some of the seeds and ribs in the pepper when you dice it up.
Add orange for a subtle but satisfying twist. Adding a little orange juice or lemon juice in addition to the lime adds a nice, subtle flavor that compliments the lime. Orange juice also adds a perfect little sweetness that can stand up to the spice.
You can substitute part of the shrimp with pieces of firm white fish, bay scallops, or even sliced octopus.

Make sure to use a preheated grill or oven.
Choose large cauliflowers.
One head of cauliflower will yield 4 thin or 2 thicker steaks, depending upon the size of your cauliflower, so if you are cooking for a group, adjust accordingly.
If you slice your cauliflower steaks too thin they may fall apart when flipping, so be careful when slicing not to go too thin!
You may have some leftover florets, just toss them on the grill too!
Allow the chimichurri sauce to sit for at least 15 mins, this enhances the flavor.
The ultimate cooking time depends on how thick you cut the steaks, and on your particular grill.
You can cook these on the grill or in the oven.
Cauliflower steaks can be cut up to 8 hours ahead of time.
Chimichurri sauce used in this recipe. You can also use pesto or just a simple garlic herb sauce.

You need ripe avocados. If you bring home still-firm avocados from your local grocery, leave them at room temperature until soft. 
For smoother guac, process for longer.
Keep from browning too quickly. Use Hass avocados, add lime to your guacamole, cover the finished mixture with plastic directly on its surface, and keep it cold--even when you serve.
Taste and adjust! Add more salt and seasoning to your taste.
If you are planning to add tomatoes and you’re looking for a good shortcut, buy some high-quality pico de gallo. It’ll save you from having to chop any vegetables and the flavors will be just about perfect!

Be sure your avocado is ripe enough. If the avocado is too hard, it is not ready to use. Too soft? Probably won’t be good in this recipe.
Ripe tomatoes are best for this sandwich because they are richer in flavor and have much more depth.
You can use either cilantro or parsley. We like parsley.
Store the chickpea and avocado salad in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days or just before the avocado browns.
Make a chickpea salad wrap by using a tortilla.

Use unsweetened almond milk, it’s low in calories and high in vitamins and minerals, it also gives a good consistency.

Honey: Honey is used instead of sugar to sweeten the sauce. Agave nectar would also work well.

To ensure evenly cooked potatoes, be sure to cut them in similar size cubes. Smaller cubes mean less cooking time.
Season your water well. Adding a good amount of salt to the potatoes as they boil means not as much salt will be needed once you mash.
Make sure to drain the potatoes well, this will give you creamy mash that’s not watery.
You can mix different potatoes for a twist on the texture.
For the extra smooth mash, warm the milk before mixing it with the potatoes. These allow the milk to be absorbed better, giving you smooth mashed potatoes.
Invest in a ricer for restaurant-quality mash. Running the potatoes through a ricer before mashing will give you that velvety smooth consistency!

Storing leftovers: Oven-roasted potatoes are best enjoyed immediately. Over time, they start to lose texture and flavor. If you do have leftovers, let them cool to room temperature and then store them in an airtight container in the fridge for 3 to 5 days.
Reheating tips: To reheat leftover potatoes, re-bake the potatoes until they’re firm and crisp. Spread the wedges on a baking sheet, drizzle them with a touch more oil, and bake them at 450 degrees for 5-6 minutes or until crispy. I wouldn’t recommend the microwave as it tends to make them even softer. Alternatively, you can also reheat them on the stovetop. Simply add them to a cast-iron skillet (or your favorite non-stick pan) with a touch of olive oil, and cook until crispy and warmed through.

You may boil the cauliflower florets in a pot for about 10-15 minutes before broiling to get a more tender cauliflower and faster cooking. Some like the cauliflower to be a bit crunchy. This is a personal preference.
Use a preheated broiler.
Heat the cheese mixture until smooth, be careful not to overheat.
If you aren’t doing a keto diet, feel free to use low-fat cheese.
You can substitute the heavy cream with milk and some butter.
The cheese sauce will thicken as it cools from boiling hot to warm. If you want it even thicker, you can add more shredded cheese.
If you have leftovers, you can reheat them in the oven or microwave.
You can use frozen cauliflower, however, it won’t have the same texture as fresh.
For a milder heat from the jalapenos, deseed them and remove the ribs.

Store any leftover asparagus in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.
Be sure to snap or cut off the tough ends of asparagus as they are not palatable.
Use any flour and breadcrumbs that work for your dietary needs. 
To make keto-friendly, swap the gluten-free flour with almond flour and use pork rinds instead of panko. 
Place your asparagus in a heavy-bottomed jar or a drinking glass when you get home, add a couple of inches of water to maintain freshness, and place it in your fridge this way. Asparagus will stay fresh several days longer this way.

If you aren't Gluten sensitive you could use Oat or whole wheat flour to make these Healthy Brown Butter Gingerbread Madeleines. As for the blackstrap Molasses, you can replace it with either honey or maple syrup.

Ideally use the appropriate, shell-shaped baking pans for this recipe. They really add a beautiful look to this little and delicious cake.
Cut your butter into pieces before browning it. This makes sure it cooks evenly.
When browning the butter, keep stirring, this stops the butter from burning and also helps to cook it evenly.
Use a light colored pan when browning butter, then you spot exactly when the butter has browned
Make sure your eggs are at room temperature. Room temperature ingredients mix more thoroughly into the batter.
Don't forget to prep you cake tin! A generous coating of butter or non stick spray means the madeleines come out more easily.
For an extra decadent touch, dip the Gluten Free Madeleines in some melted gluten free chocolate!
Allow to cool before dusting.

Use whatever chopped nuts you like.
Don’t overwork the mash. You don’t want a super smooth mash for potato casserole because it won’t hold together properly. A coarser mash gives the casserole its character and body.
You don’t need to add sugar. Although brown sugar is often used in classic sweet potato casseroles, this recipe really does have built-in sweetness!
Use a preheated oven.
For a deeper flavor to your nuts, toast them up!
Ideally, let this Healthy Sweet Potato Casserole stand at room temperature for around 10 mins before serving.

We used rolled oats, but you may use quick oats. The key is to blend in a food processor.
If you don’t have a food processor, 1 cup of rolled oats blended will yield just about 1 cup of oat flour or any other flour. If using flour start with 1 and 1/4th cup of four and if needed add another 1/4 cup.
To make this vegan-friendly, use any non-dairy milk, and egg substitutes. For every one whole egg, you will need 1/4 cup of egg substitute. Also, top with a non-dairy yogurt.
Don’t have any of the spices mentioned? you can sub with 1 tsp of pumpkin spice.
Wrap and save the remaining pancakes in the fridge for up to 4 days.

Make sure to keep the oats in the refrigerator for at least four hours or overnight. These oats need extra time to absorb milk to become soft and tender.
If you don’t have maple syrup as a sweetener, you can use honey or Lakanto Monk Fruit Sweetener. Agave will work well too for a vegan option.
Rolled oats are best for this recipe as they tend to be a bit more tender. We have not tried Instant Oats for this recipe. You may use instant oats but the texture will vary.
If you are maintaining a gluten-free diet, then make sure the oats have not been cross-contaminated with gluten. Use gluten-free oats.

When choosing zucchini, the squash should feel heavy for its size. The skin should be a dark green color and smooth and ideally blemish-free. If the skin looks slightly shriveled, it's most likely not freshly picked.
Don't overcook the zucchini, it should remain crisp and bright green.
Add some chili flakes for a punch of spiciness.
Sprinkle on some fresh parsley as garnish. Parsley works great on corn and zucchini!
You can use frozen, canned, or fresh corn kernels.
If time allows, grill your corn for another layer of flavor!

But other options that you may consider with ingredients you already have at home are flaxseed, yogurt, buttermilk, silken tofu, applesauce. replace 1 egg with 1/4 cup of all the above. If you are replacing it with flaxseed, mix 1 tablespoon of flaxseed with 3 tablespoons of water.
Milk: Any milk will work in this recipe.
Nut butter: We used peanut butter, but you can use any nut butter like almond butter or cashew butter.
Sweetener: We used maple syrup, but you can use honey or agave. If you want to use coconut sugar or monk fruit sweetener it’s fine too.

Storage:
If you don’t get to finish this you can simply cover it and store it in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave for 30 seconds.

If your avocado has a small pit, use a spoon to remove some of the avocado meat and make room for the egg.
You’ll need to keep the avocado upright, so the egg stays in. You can place them in ramekins to make it easier.
If you don’t have a ramekin, no problem! You can lean the avocados next to each, supporting them.
Use a preheated oven.
When cracking the eggs into the avocado, be careful not to break the yolk.
For a spicy kick, sprinkle on some crushed red chili flakes.
In place of Parmesan, you can tip with cheddar or crumbled feta
Top with chopped fresh tomato, for a pop of freshness.
Try looking for the larger avocados since they work better for this recipe. They have a larger pit and thus larger space for eggs.

Storing leftovers: Store leftover mashed potatoes in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
Freezing: Vegan mashed potatoes will keep for a month or two in a freezer-safe container. I like to use a freezer bag because they lie flat in the freezer. There’s no need to thaw them before reheating.
Reheating: To reheat individual portions, use the microwave. If you have larger amounts, heat them in a heavy pan or skillet on the stove over low heat or put them into a baking dish, cover with foil, and heat them at 350°F until heated through.
What to Consider: to make an extra creamy mashed potato, add 1/4 cup of vegan cream cheese.

The serving size is one full egg. So two halves.
Use a sharp knife when cutting the boiled eggs in half.
To add the filling, use a piping bag for pretty and less messy-looking deviled eggs. If you do not have a piping bag, you can use a ziplock bag. Just cut the tip of the ziplock bag.
Cook your eggs using your preferred method, whether you choose boiling, steaming, or baking. The key is placing the cooked eggs in an ice bath afterward.
This is a great make-ahead recipe. If you plan to make these keto deviled eggs ahead, you can cook the eggs and make the filling but do not fill the eggs just yet until ready to serve. Store the filling in a ziplock bag or a container separate from the egg whites. 
You can easily double or triple this recipe for a larger crowd.
The yolk should be pale yellow and firm, but not dry. 
You may use mayo in place of Greek yogurt if your main diet is a high-fat keto diet.

For a non-Gluten-Free version of these Healthy Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Cookies, you can use whole wheat or oat flour.
For a non-vegan version, you can use dark chocolate chips and honey in place of maple syrup.
Allow the cookies to cool on a cooling rack for a while. They are certainly delicious and warm, right from the oven, however,  their chewiness and flavor do intensify over time.
The cookies spread just slightly in the oven, so it’s best to gently flatten out the cookie dough balls (just a bit) with your hand or the back of a spoon before baking.
This cookie recipe can easily be doubled by doubling each ingredient.
Use canned pumpkin for the best consistency. Don’t use canned pumpkin pie filling, it contains added sweeteners and spices.
Line your baking sheet, don’t grease it otherwise will brown too much and spread out.
Be careful not to under-bake the cookies or they’ll taste raw, and don’t over-bake or they won’t be soft.

Sweeten it up. This blueberry smoothie should be perfectly sweet, but if you’d like it sweeter you can add a 1/2 tablespoon of honey, pure maple syrup, a bit of stevia, or a Medjool date.
Add greens. If you’re looking to get more greens in your diet, try adding a handful or two of baby spinach or kale leaves. It will turn the smoothie a different color, but you won’t be able to taste the greens.
Different fruit. Feel free to sub the blueberries for strawberries, raspberries, mango, cherries, pineapple, peaches, or any other favorite. Just be sure to use frozen fruit for the best results.
Add an extra boost of nutrition. Try adding in a serving of protein powder, flax seed, hemp seeds, or oats.

Make sure to spritz your donut molds with non stick spray.
For an even bolder flavor, you can reduce the apple cider down by simmering it for 20 mins. This gives an eve stronger apple taste.
You might notice the batter is thick, this is fine! Thicker donuts give us a more cakey bite!
If you don't have a piping bag that's fine. Pour your batter into a zipped-top bag, then cut the corner off and pipe it into the donut pan.
To check the doneness of these baked donuts, poke your finger into the top of one. If the donut bounces back, they are done.
You can add some ground nutmeg to the topping for more festive flavors.

For Super Fluffy Waffles. If a light and fluffy waffle interior is important to you, separate your eggs. Add the beaten yolks to the wet ingredients of your batter. Then, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold the eggs whites gently into the final batter using a spatula.
Don't Lift The Lid Too Early. If you lift to peek at the waffles too early you may rip them. Wait until the light goes off. If your waffle maker doesn't have a doneness indicator, watch the steam coming out of the unit as you cook.

We highly recommend adding the kale pesto to the steak and asparagus because it makes things taste way better but you can leave it off, too.
Allow the steaks come to room temperature for thirty minutes before cooking. This allows the meat to cook evenly.
If you’d like a thinner pesto, add more olive oil in a slow, steady stream with the food processor running.
You can use any kind of steak for this sheet pan dinner such as flank, sirloin, skirt steak, ribeye, etc.
Be sure to season your steak to make sure it full of yummy savory flavors.
Remove the kale stems before blitzing in the food processor.
If desired, add extra salt, lemon juice, and freshly ground black pepper to the pesto.
Be sure to preheat the broiler for the steak or the steak will not cook as well.
Allowing the steak to sit at room temperature before serving allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat and become absorbed.
Use other vegetables like zucchini, carrots, mushrooms, green beans, and others to switch things up for this sheet meal.

Use small to medium carrots and ideally buy a pack of similar-sized ones, so they all cook at the same rate. Carrots that are too small won’t have time to caramelize and if they are too big they will take too long to roast.
Make sure to peel and trim the edges of the carrots.
For the best maple flavor use a dark (grade A) pure maple syrup.
If you don’t like maple syrup, you can use agave syrup.

If you’re using cauliflower rice in salads and as a soup mix-in, there’s no need to cook it first. When it’s being used as a side, in a pilaf, or as the base for a veggie bowl, riced cauliflower can benefit from a quick sauté in a pan.
 Leave riced cauliflower on the heat too long and it will become soggy.
Cauliflower rice at its best when it’s used the day it’s made. This is when the grains will be most firm and rice-like. It's best to make it no more than a day or two ahead of time.
A good-sized cast iron, stainless steel or non-stick skillets are your best choices for this cauliflower rice. Avoid a saucepan, they are too deep and the cauliflower rice doesn’t cook through as quickly or evenly.

Slice evenly cut fries, so they all cook at the same rate, no burning and no underdone fries here!
Don’t overcrowd the fries. Make sure they are spread evenly on a single layer so they all cook evenly. 
Line the baking tray with parchment paper to prevent sticking. 
If you want these sweet potato fries extra crispy you can coat them with about 2 teaspoons. But they come out just as good without!
For further crispiness swap olive oil for ghee.
If you have time, soak your uncooked sweet potato fries in cold water for 30 mins up to overnight. This removes excess starch and makes them even more crispy.
If you can wait - allow to cool for 5 mins, this will make them crispier!
For a spicy kick, add some chili flakes after baking.

Vegan option: use non-dairy yogurt to garnish the soup.
If you don’t have fresh ginger, use 1 tablespoon of ginger powder
For added protein and nonvegetarian option, consider adding some shredded chicken
Any oil will work in place of the olive oil. Go for vegetable oil, avocado oil, or grapeseed oil.

Buy broccoli and cut it into florets. It’s fresher this way and you have control over how big you want your florets.
Stir your pasta as soon as you drop it in the water, this prevents the pasta from sticking.
Cook your pasta a minute short of al dente, this will make sure your pasta isn’t too mushy after baking.
You can use any fat content milk you’d like to make this dish rich and creamy, or lighter.
Ideally, shred your own cheddar, pre-shredded cheddar never melts that well.
Add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, for a touch of heat, if you like.
Add a dash of nutmeg for a touch of warming winter flavor.

Use a preheated oven.
To check doneness, use a knife inserted in the center, if it comes out clean, the Cranberry Orange Bread is ready.
This bread was made without orange juice. If you would like to add some, you may add about 1/2 a cup but you would have to add another 1/4 cup of oat or gluten-free flour.
You can whip up a couple of these as easily as one, so feel free to double the ingredients. One for you and one for a friend (or two for you!).
Use a greased loaf pan.
If you like, add some chopped nuts. Nuts are a wonderful addition and compliment the flavors of the bread beautifully.
 If using frozen cranberries, you do not need to thaw them.
Invest in an oven thermometer. If you don’t have one already, they are great for baking! Most ovens vary in temperature, an inexpensive oven thermometer is a great way to bake your loaf perfectly

Make sure to spritz your donut molds with non-stick spray.
If you prefer not to coat these Pumpkin Donuts with cinnamon sugar, you can glaze them with some maple syrup or try them with some cream cheese. Oh so yummy! My kids prefer the cinnamon sugar and I love the maple syrup.
You can skip the protein in this recipe if you aren’t into protein. You can always add more flour instead. Use about 1/4 cup of flour in place of the 1 scoop of protein.
Make sure to use pumpkin puree and not pumpkin pie filling.
When the donuts are looking almost done, gently prod them with the top of your finger. If the donut bounces back, they’re done. If your finger leaves a mark, the donuts need a bit longer in the oven. You can also test with a toothpick, stick one in and if it comes out clean, they are done. 
Let the donuts cool for just 5 minutes before coating them in the cinnamon/sugar mix. If they are totally cool, the coating will not stick well.
If you want a quick, clean and easy way to transfer the donut batter into the molds, cut a corner in a ziplock bag and pipe the batter in that way.

Be sure to line your baking sheet with parchment paper.
You can use any glass cup to cut out the round shapes
I used a star shape cutter for the center of the cookies, but you can use whatever shapes you like, or leave the cookies whole.
Save the center shapes and bake them for mini short breads.
Let the cookies cool before spreading jam on them.
Dust lightly with some powdered sugar for a lovely presentation and subtle sweetness.
I went for vanilla flavored whey protein powder as it doesn't overpower the cookie taste.
Your shortbread cookies should come out near white, not brown otherwise they will be too brittle. But do make sure the cookies are fully baked.

What chicken to use? You can use freshly cooked chicken, leftover chicken, or rotisserie chicken for this salad. It’s fine to dice or shred the meat, although we prefer the texture of shredded chicken.
Low carb option: Instead of serving it on bread, try a keto-friendly wrap or add the chicken salad to a lettuce cup. You can even just eat the salad as it is. It’s so fresh and crisp!
Store any leftover chicken salad in an airtight container for 3-5 days in the fridge.
We don’t recommend freezing chicken salad. It can separate when it thaws and becomes watery, losing its creamy texture and taste. However, you can freeze the cooked chicken, then just defrost it in the refrigerator the day before you want to make the salad, and add the other fresh ingredients just before serving.

As you start to measure out the ingredients, grab two bowls and measure out the dry ingredients in one bowl then measure out the wet ingredients in another bowl.  Then it will be simple to add wet and dry ingredients together and mix.

Make sure to use pumpkin puree and not pumpkin pie filling. Pumpkin pie filling has a completely different flavor. 
Use baking soda not baking powder.

Chicken: You can use chicken thighs if you would like. They may take a little longer to cook and the nutritional profile may be a bit different as chicken breasts are leaner. Consider using Rotisserie chicken.
Pasta: Don’t overcook the pasta. Cook until al dente. Do not rinse the pasta. Consider using lentil or chickpea pasta for an even healthier option.
Gluten-free: To make this recipe completely gluten-free, substitute with gluten-free pasta.
Garlic: For the freshest flavor, we like to use fresh garlic cloves, but garlic powder will work if in a pinch.
Spinach: We used fresh spinach but you may use frozen.
Milk: 2% milk works great but if you prefer using dairy-free milk go right ahead.
Grate your own cheese for the best flavor if possible.

Additions: We love to toss in corn or fresh cilantro if we have some on hand. They pair perfectly with the other southwest flavors of this Santa Fe Salad. Also, a sprinkle of cheese on top is so tasty. We recommend shredded Mexican cheese or cheddar.
Like a little heat? You can add extra chili powder to the chicken seasoning before grilling, or add sliced fresh jalapeños to the salad. You can also drizzle some spicy salsa over the top!
This salad is perfect for meal prep! Prepare all of the ingredients and portion the salad into 4 individual containers, with 4 small pots of salad dressing stored separately, and the tortilla chips stored in 4 ziplock bags in the pantry. This is such a tasty grab-and-go recipe!
Store any leftover salad in an airtight container for up to 3 days. If it’s possible, store the salad dressing separately from the rest of the salad to preserve the greens a little longer.

Make-ahead tips: consider cooking the quinoa a day before. You can also marinate the chicken breast the night before to save on prep time when ready to make this chicken bowl.
Swap the quinoa with cauliflower rice to cut down on the calories.
You can use avocado oil instead of olive oil.
Fresh, frozen, or canned corn. 
Grill the chicken indoors on a grill pan or use an outdoor grill. 
Do not overcook the chicken to prevent it from getting too dry and rubbery.

Use a preheated broiler.
If you prefer less heat, remove the ribs and seeds from the jalapenos.
If your sour cream is too thick to drizzle, you can thin out your sour cream with 1/2 teaspoon of water.
Don’t cut the bell pepper nachos too thin. You want them to be able to hold a good amount of toppings and dip nicely without bending.
You can use normal sized or mini bell peppers. Just cut into similar sizes.
Ideally, avoid pre-shredded cheese, shred your own, it melts much better.
If you don’t need them vegetarian, you can top with cooked ground beef/chicken/turkey. Add some taco seasoning to the ground meat.
You can make this vegan by omitting the cheese and sour cream. Use vegan-friendly cheese instead

Season with your favorite seasonings! Some that would taste amazing on these avocado fries are cajun or creole seasoning, chili powder, hot paprika, taco seasoning, and Old Bay seasoning.
The easiest way to remove avocado from its peel is to slice it in half around its seed, and then take a large spoon and scoop the flesh out around the edges keeping it in one piece. You can also slice the avocado into “fries” before scooping the flesh out.
Do not use avocados that are too ripe. They need to be firm to the touch.
Allow the avocado fries to cool before eating them. They will be hot inside!
You can serve these as an appetizer, side dish, snack, or (my favorite) as tacos in a tortilla topped with cheese, salsa, cilantro, and sour cream. They make the best tacos!

If you are using chicken thighs, then you may need to cook the chicken a longer. Just make sure the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit.
You can use maple syrup or any other type of liquid sweetener in place of the honey.
For gluten-free Asian chili chicken, use coconut aminos or Tamari.
Arrowroot powder will work in place of cornstarch. Tapioca starch can also work.
Fresh ginger and garlic will add extra bold flavors.
Instant Pot Directions: Follow the directions as you would for the stovetop, but use the Sauté function on the IP. Add the chicken to the pressure cooker once hot. You will follow the exact cooking time and everything!
Bake this spicy and sweet Asian chicken breast in the oven at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for fifteen to eighteen minutes. The skin on the chicken will be crispy! Chicken thighs will take longer to cook. Make sure the internal temperature is 165 degrees Fahrenheit with a meat thermometer.
For a vegetarian version, use tofu instead of chicken. Crispy tofu is delicious!

NOTE: *****To make this dish healthier we used almond milk. But you can use any other milk, heavy cream, or whipping cream if you don’t mind it. Also, be careful not to use sweetened almond milk!!!!****
Pasta: use pasta of choice. Gluten-free, whole wheat, lentil pasta, or chickpea pasta.
Chicken: we used chicken breast but you may use boneless thighs. Consider using shrimp instead of chicken if desired.
Spinach: we recommend using fresh spinach. Frozen spinach can be used but thaw first and drain to remove excess water.
Use fresh garlic or replace it with 1 tablespoon of garlic powder.
Cook the pasta al dente since it will cook again with everything else to prevent having soft and soggy pasta.
Store leftover chicken pasta in a container and store it in the fridge for up to 3 days.

Cauliflower: Pick out a cauliflower head that is firm, pale, and has no dark spots. You can store it in the fridge for 4-7 days before using it. 
Milk: We use dairy milk, but you can substitute it with an unsweetened dairy-free option. 
Flour: Gluten-free, whole wheat, or regular flour will work well. 
Allow the air fryer to fully come to temperature before you start cooking for the best results. 
Make sure to not overcrowd the air fryer or sheet pan, or else they can’t get crispy. If needed, cook the cauliflower in two batches.
To make this vegan, you can skip the egg and use an egg wash substitute along with dairy-free milk. Also, make sure you are using a vegan-friendly buffalo sauce.
Storage: These are best served fresh, but if you have leftovers you can store them in the fridge for 2-3 days. Reheat in the air fryer or under the broiler in the oven to restore some of the crispiness.

Do not overmix your batter. If you overmix, the muffins will be dense.
Bake until golden brown and toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
The icing should be thin enough to drizzle from the tip of the spoon. Add a splash more almond milk if needed. 
You can use a cookie or ice cream scoop to portion out the batter into the tins. 
You can choose to either grease the muffin tin or line it with paper liners. If you choose to go without liners, make sure you grease the base and sides of the cups with oil spray or a bit of melted butter

Add jalapenos for a spicier kick, add some jalapenos to the mixture when you are blending it. I don't do this often because my kids definitely can't handle the heat. But it's a hit when you are making this for some adult guests that come over. 
Invest in a good food processor. For achieving the perfect creamy consistency, you're going to want to invest in a good food processor or blender.
Avoid bottled lemon juice, use freshly squeezed lemon juice to lend your blend that freshness and zest.
Add an avocado, great for guac lovers! Simply add fiber-filled avocado chunks with cilantro and a few dashes of cumin while the hummus is blending, and watch how the texture turns even smoother and richer.

Even though I use coconut oil, this does not taste of coconuts. If you like coconuts, add some shavings.
Allow the granola to cool before adding the chocolate chips.
Press down the pre-cooked granola with a spatula to create a uniform layer. This helps with the formation of lovely, crunchy little clumps!
As the granola cools on the baking sheet, it continues to form clusters and hardens just a bit, so be sure not to wait until your granola has really browned to pull it out of the oven.

You can store it covered in your refrigerator for up to 2 days, just heat through when ready to serve.
Use a wild rice blend that includes several varieties of rice. This allows the dish to have a texture balance of fluffiness, tenderness, and a slight chewiness.
Since there are different brands of wild rice blends, be sure to cook according to your package instructions, veering towards the tender side. If the rice seems a bit too firm after cooking, mix in just enough extra broth to moisten all the rice, and cover/simmer 10 more minutes or until tender but not overly cooked.
Add some freshly shaved brussels sprouts in this rice pilaf recipe; you can use a bag of pre-shaved fresh brussels sprouts if your grocery store carries it. If not, it’s simple to slice your own.
 If reheating after a night in the fridge, sprinkle with a bit of broth evenly over the top just prior to reheating, which ensures that rice stays moist.

after roasting for the first time, allow it to cool so you can handle it and over burned hands!
For bigger dinners, you can easily multiply the squash.
Do not attempt to Hasselback the squash without partially cooking it first.
When slicing the squash you can place them on two chopsticks or a big serving spoon, to stop you from slicing right through.
You can omit the chili flakes or up the chili flakes, depending on how much spice you like!
To help prevent burning, add a couple of tbsp of water to the pan as and when needed.
Nudge the layers apart if they’re still sticking together and make sure some of the honey garlic glazes drips down into the space between the slices.
When transferring the Hasselback Butternut Squash to a serving plate, make sure to support it well as it’ll be fragile.
This squash is best straight from the oven while the edges are at their crispiest!

Olive oil: You can also use sunflower, grapeseed oil, or peanut oil.

Pumpkin puree: Make sure to use unsweetened puree. You can also substitute with homemade pumpkin puree.
Peanut Butter: It gives this recipe a nutty and creamy taste. You may dissolve the peanut butter with a bit of water in a bowl first before adding it in.
Beans: Cannellini beans are also called white kidney beans. You can substitute with Great Northern beans or navy beans.
Broth: You can use low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth. Canned, boxed, or homemade broth is great.
When cooking the meat, make sure to break it up into small pieces with a spatula or meat masher.

It is a good dish to make ahead of time if you have guests coming. If it has to be made ahead, prior to serving just reheat in microwave or oven for a few minutes and serve.
To steam the brussel sprouts either use a bamboo steamer or your preferred choice of steaming
If you don't have a steamer, steam the Brussel Sprouts in boiling water for 4-5 minutes until fork tender. Discard the water. This is what you refer to as blanching.

If using a bamboo steamer, place the bamboo steamer into a wide-rimmed, shallow pan or skillet, and fill it with enough water to come up above the bottom rim of the steamer by about a quarter inch. For easy cleaning, line the steamer with parchment paper.
Add in the sprouts, and cover with the lid. Steam over high heat until almost tender, about 5-6 minutes.

use sweet white Onions.
you can use almond flour instead of blending the raw almonds
grate your own parmesan cheese for better taste
If you don’t have an air fryer, you may bake in the oven at 350F for 20 minutes or so. Keep an eye on it.
Flour: any flour works. Gluten-free flour can be used if you have gluten-allergies
Do not freeze, they will just turn out soggy. Unless you plan to cook them halfway, freeze and continue air-frying next time. This is more for those that want to make it ahead.
You may store leftovers but they will lose their crunch.
For sweeter and milder tasting onion rings, you may soak the sliced onions in an ice water bath for 10-15 minutes. If you are using sweet onions we really don’t think this is a necessary step.

Brown rice: Have this cooked before you start making the casserole.
Broccoli: Trim the leaves from the broccoli and cut the florets close to the stalk. Then trim the florets so they are roughly the same size. Alternatively, you can buy florets pre-cut.
Onion: We prefer sweet or yellow onion in this recipe.
Gluten-free flour: You can use regular flour if you do not have gluten restrictions.
Milk: Use non-dairy milk to make this recipe vegan.
Cheddar cheese: You can omit the cheese or use light/fat-free, or substitute with mozzarella, Colby, or parmesan.
Storage: Store wrapped in tinfoil or in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days. 
Freezing: Freeze after cooking the chicken and adding the broccoli, rice, and sauce. Wrap tightly in tinfoil or store in an air-tight container. Freeze for up to 3 months, then thaw overnight in the fridge. Bake as directed. Alternatively, freeze after it has been cooked. Wrap tightly or store in an air-tight container, freeze for up to 3 months, then reheat in the microwave or oven.

Use a preheated oven.
Make sure your egg is up to room temp.
Medium-sized berries work best, they hold their shape and don’t overwhelm any individual scone.
If using frozen blueberries, no need to defrost them.
Don’t overwork the dough, as this can leave you with a tougher texture.
Scones are best served warm.
If you like, you can boost the flavor of the almond flour with some almond extract.
This recipe is easily doubled.

For a vegan option, use dairy-free dark chocolate chips.

I used dark chocolate chips, but you can use milk chocolate if you prefer.
For the jelly, use any of your favorite sugar-free jelly flavors.

Cauliflower: Pick out a cauliflower head that is firm, pale, and has no dark spots. You can store it in the fridge for 4-7 days before using it. 
Milk: We use dairy milk, but you can substitute it with an unsweetened dairy-free option. 
Flour: Gluten-free, whole wheat, or regular flour will work well. 
Allow the air fryer to fully come to temperature before you start cooking for the best results. 
Make sure to not overcrowd the air fryer or sheet pan, or else they can’t get crispy. If needed, cook the cauliflower in two batches.
To make this vegan, you can skip the egg and use an egg wash substitute along with dairy-free milk. Also, make sure you are using a vegan-friendly buffalo sauce.
Storage: These are best served fresh, but if you have leftovers you can store them in the fridge for 2-3 days. Reheat in the air fryer or under the broiler in the oven to restore some of the crispiness.

Storage: Shish Tawook is best served the same day. If you do have leftovers, you can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. You may reheat it in the microwave. If you prefer to reheat in a toaster oven, make sure you wrap up the chicken in foil to prevent them from drying out.
Marinade: The longer you marinate the chicken shish Tawook the better. At the very minimum, you should marinate for 30 minutes to 4 hours. If you can make it the night before and allow it to marinate in the fridge overnight that would be ideal.

Season with your favorite seasonings! Some that would taste amazing on these avocado fries are cajun or creole seasoning, chili powder, hot paprika, taco seasoning, and Old Bay seasoning.
The easiest way to remove avocado from its peel is to slice it in half around its seed, and then take a large spoon and scoop the flesh out around the edges keeping it in one piece. You can also slice the avocado into “fries” before scooping the flesh out.
Do not use avocados that are too ripe. They need to be firm to the touch.
Allow the avocado fries to cool before eating them. They will be hot inside!
You can serve these as an appetizer, side dish, snack, or (my favorite) as tacos in a tortilla topped with cheese, salsa, cilantro, and sour cream. They make the best tacos!

Flour: Feel free to mix flour at a 50/50 ratio using any of your favorite flour. We have tested this with a 50/50 ratio of all-purpose and almond flour and it came out perfect.
Oil: we used coconut oil but other oil can be used like vegetable oil, grapeseed oil, sunflower oil, or olive oil.
Use a preheated oven. The bread will need a good 40-50 minutes depending on the oven. Use a toothpick to check for doneness.
Allow the banana nut bread to cool off completely before cutting through
You may add other toppings like chocolate chips, but not needed at all. This banana bread is sweet enough.
Coconut sugar: You may use any other sugar like cane sugar, monk fruit, or brown sugar. Honey and Maple syrup also work but use only 1/2 cup of either honey or maple syrup.
For a vegan option, you may use an egg substitute like flax seeds or egg replacers

Add jalapenos for a spicier kick, add some jalapenos to the mixture when you are blending it. I don't do this often because my kids definitely can't handle the heat. But it's a hit when you are making this for some adult guests that come over. 
Invest in a good food processor. For achieving the perfect creamy consistency, you're going to want to invest in a good food processor or blender.
Avoid bottled lemon juice, use freshly squeezed lemon juice to lend your blend that freshness and zest.
Add an avocado, great for guac lovers! Simply add fiber-filled avocado chunks with cilantro and a few dashes of cumin while the hummus is blending, and watch how the texture turns even smoother and richer.

Butternut squash: Choose squash that feels heavy for its size and isn’t bruised or punctured.

You can, of course, roast or pan fry the chicken and shred that, if you wish.
You can sub chicken for ground turkey, or ground beef.
Olive or avocado oil is good.
You can use any broth you have handy.
If you are watching your salt intake, opt for low sodium chicken broth and low sodium canned beans.
Skip the cheese and other dairy toppings for a lactose-free option
For a vegan option, use vegetable broth and skip the chicken.
If topping with shredded cheese, ideally shred your own. Pre-shredded cheese doesn’t melt that well.

Pasta: use any pasta of choice that suits your dietary needs. For healthier pasta options, use lentil or chickpea pasta.
Chicken: we always prefer chicken breast over chicken thighs since they are leaner. But if you prefer using boneless chicken thighs that’s fine. 
Marinara sauce: you may use your favorite brand or make your own sauce at home. We have a homemade marinara sauce you can check out. 
Parmesan cheese: Try shredding your own parmesan cheese for the best flavor possible. Store-bought is fine.

Cut and slice the eggplant for not only baking and using the stovetop with the oven, but prepared eggplant is also great for grilling.
Be sure the eggplant is ripe but not too ripe. 
Freeze the sliced or cut eggplant in freezer-safe storage bags in the freezer for up to four months. Thaw the eggplant when you are ready to use it–it’s great for meal prep.
Use the eggplant for all of your vegetarian needs when you do not want to use meat. An eggplant is a great option for meatless lasagna.

Use fresh lemon juice. Store-bought lemon juice always tastes stale and sad, and it will make your hummus taste stale and sad. Buy lemons and your humus will taste fresh and delicious.
For a more mellow tasting hummus, mince the garlic in the food processor or blender with the lemon juice and let that mixture rest for a few minutes, the garlic will lose its harsh, raw bite and mellow out.
Sprinkle of ground sumac, which is sour and deep pink, it balances out the hummus so well. Or sprinkle on some paprika, for a splash of color.
You only need a handful of ingredients to make a delightful hummus, so why not use the best quality fixings you can find? Wholesome, organic ingredients will result in a tastier, healthier hummus.
 Top off your dip with sliced pickles for a satisfying crunch.
For a creamier hummus, tenderize the chickpeas using baking soda in the overnight soaking of the chickpeas,
Invest in some good tahini like Soom or Al Arz, it's worth it!

Chop your potatoes into similar sized pieces, so they cook evenly.
Use an oven-safe skillet or pan.
For more Greek flavor, add some sliced, pitted kalamata olives on top.
Use a preheated oven.
Also, it’s best to preheat your skillet before adding in the potatoes, so they come up to roasting temp in line with the recipe.
For best results, use some tongs to flip your potatoes, halfway through baking.
For a spicy kick, add a sprinkle of crushed chili flakes.
Swap feta for shredded cheddar for a different flavor profile.
You can also swap dill for fresh parsley.

Use shrimp that has already been peeled, deveined, and cooked for ease! Just make sure the shrimp are thawed if frozen, and proceed with the rest of the recipe.
Look for a ripe, but firm avocado. A soft avocado can get mushy when you toss everything together.
Make sure the red onion is finely chopped so that you don’t get large pieces in each bite. You can also use sliced green onions instead of red onion for a milder flavor.
We love to make this salad ahead of time. Refrigerate for at least one hour before serving. This adds a freshness to the salad and also allows time for the dressing to soften the veggies.

Cut the flank steak against the grain to make the steak less tough. This shortens the beef fibers and makes chewing much easier.
Cook flank steak to medium-rare for the most tender texture. A well-done steak will be chewy and harder to break down.

Use either chicken breasts or chicken thighs! Thighs will be juicier and breasts are a leaner cut of meat. They are both delicious options for this Jerk Chicken Recipe.

Make everything ahead of time! I like to prep everything the evening or morning before to allow all of the flavors to develop in both the meat and the salsa.
Make double and freeze half. This is a great hack if you are a busy household! I make double and freeze the jerk chicken recipe in the ziplock bag while it marinates. Then I can use it up to 3 months later. Just thaw it overnight until it’s completely defrosted and cook!

Be sure your avocado is ripe enough. If the avocado is too hard, it is not ready to use. Too soft? Probably won’t be good in this recipe.
Ripe tomatoes are best for this sandwich because they are richer in flavor and have much more depth.
You can use either cilantro or parsley. We like parsley.
Store the chickpea and avocado salad in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days or just before the avocado browns.
Make a chickpea salad wrap by using a tortilla.

We recommend choosing chicken breasts that are approximately the same size so that they cook at the same rate. 
Since chicken breasts can vary in size, we recommend using a meat thermometer to make sure that the chicken breast is fully cooked; the temperature should read 165 degrees F.
We like to use freshly grated Parmesan cheese, as it has more flavor and melts smoothly.
Want to add a garnish before serving? Plate your creamy chicken skillet with fresh herbs. Parsley, chives, basil, or thyme are all great options.

Allow the cookies to cool before glazing, otherwise, the glaze will not harden.
For this recipe use pure canned pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling. Pumpkin pie filling is loaded with other ingredients and flavorings, that'll also change the flavor of these healthy pumpkin cookies.
Ideally use a cookie scoop to portion out the cookie dough.
Sprinkle a touch of pumpkin spice onto the finished glazed cookies for an extra spice hit!
Don’t overbake the cookies. You want these Healthy Pumpkin Cookies nice and soft, not dry. When you pull them out of the oven, they will look slightly underbaked but will continue to bake on the cookie sheet for a couple more minutes- perfect!
To measure your flour accurately, spoon the flour into the measuring cup until it's overfilled. Then, use the back of a butter knife to push off the excess flour.

Storage
Chicken Gnocchi Soup is best the same day it’s made. When stored, the gnocchi absorbs liquid and can become overly soft and mushy. However, if you do have leftovers, store them in an airtight container and refrigerate them for up to 3 days. You may want to add in a bit more stock when reheating leftovers.

The gnocchi continues to take on liquid as it sits, so this soup isn’t a great candidate for freezing and thawing.

Use a preheated oven.
Make sure to spritz your donut molds with non stick spray.
For an even bolder flavor, you can reduce the apple cider down by simmering it for 20 mins. This gives an eve stronger apple taste.
You might notice the batter is thick, this is fine! Thicker donuts give us a more cakey bite!
If you don't have a piping bag that's fine. Pour your batter into a zipped-top bag, then cut the corner off and pipe it into the donut pan.
To check the doneness of these baked donuts, poke your finger into the top of one. If the donut bounces back, they are done.
You can add some ground nutmeg to the topping for more festive flavors.

Spinach: We used frozen, but you can also use fresh spinach chopped into small pieces. 
Feta cheese: If you buy your feta in a block, make sure to crumble it into small chunks before cooking. This will help it distribute evenly in the eggs. 
Avocado oil: Substitute with olive oil, peanut oil, grapeseed oil, or canola oil. 
Don’t forget to grease the muffin tin, or the egg cups will stick to the pan. 
If you substitute with other veggies, make sure to chop them into small pieces for the best texture. 
Storage: Egg cups or egg muffins last for up to 5 days in the fridge when stored in a sealed container. 
Freezing: Let them cool completely, then freeze in a sealed container or zipper bag for up to 3 months. You can reheat them from frozen in the microwave for 30-60 seconds, or until warm.

You can use fresh or frozen salmon fillets for this recipe. I prefer to use fresh, but if you use frozen, be sure to defrost it thoroughly before you begin cooking. Pat the fillets with paper towel to remove any excess moisture.
Cooking times may vary depending on the thickness of your fillet.
Use a non stick, flat pan to cook the salmon. The fish is more likely to stick on cast iron and stainless steel pans.
If you are using an instant read thermometer, it should register at 145ºF.
Take care not to overcook the salmon. When over cooked it can become dry and chewy.

Go for pumpkin puree, not pumpkin pie filling. Pumpkin pie filling is often loaded with additives and gives the muffins the wrong flavor.
Make sure your ingredients are up to room temp before mixing.
You can use coconut sugar or low-calorie sweetener.
When combining your wet and dry ingredients don’t overmix, otherwise, the batter will make tough muffins.
You can use a cookie scoop to evenly portion the batter into the molds.
Make sure you line the muffin pan with paper liners or grease the muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray.
Don’t over-bake the muffins. Take these Healthy Pumpkin Muffins out when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
