You may use coconut milk or any other milk of choice.\nGnocchi: if you don\u2019t have gnocchi on hand, you can substitute it with gluten-free pasta.

Try cauliflower gnocchi found at health food stores like trader joes.\u00a0\nMake your own chicken stock if you can.\u00a0\nChicken: You can swap with a protein of your choice.

For a vegan option, use plant-based protein powder.\nInstead of dark chocolate chips, switch things up with white chocolate, peanut butter, or butterscotch chips. Use dairy-free for a vegan option\nIn place of the peanuts, roasted almonds or cashews can be used.\nFor extra nutty flavors, sprinkle some unsweetened shredded coconut in the oat mixture and on top before baking.\nIf you do not want to mix the ingredients by hand, then you can mix things in a food processor.\nStore the leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for four days. The bars will last longer stored in the refrigerator for up to one week.\nFreeze the bars by cutting them into squares and freezing them in a freezer-safe bag for three months.\nAdd rich aromatic spices to these soft baked bars such as cinnamon or nutmeg.\nDried fruit such as cranberries, raisins, dates, etc. will work great for this recipe!\n"

Using your hands or a large spoon, mix thoroughly until well combined.Heat oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat.

Add chopped leeks, cook until leeks are softened.Stir in the potatoes and broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then once it starts to bubble reduce the heat to low and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the asparagus and cook for 5 minutes longer.Remove from the heat and stir in the fresh basil, reserving a few leaves to garnish the soup. Using an immersion blender, puree the soup.Taste and adjust the salt and pepper according to your taste.Pour the soup into bowls. Add a dollop of yogurt to each bowl. Garnish with fresh basil leaves and pine nuts. Enjoy!",
            "notes": "\nLeeks: Choose leeks that have at least 2-3 inches of clean, white bottom stalks. The tops should be dark green and tightly rolled, not wimpy or soggy looking.\nYukon gold potatoes: These are our favorite potatoes for this recipe since they soften nicely. You can substitute with any other yellow-skinned potato, red potatoes, or sweet potatoes.\nAsparagus: Choose asparagus stalks that are firm and stand up straight. We prefer medium width asparagus stalks. Avoid very thick stalks as they tend to be woodier.\nGreek yogurt: You can leave this out for a dairy-free or vegan option. You can also substitute with a dash of heavy cream on each bowl instead.\nPine nuts: These also go by pinoli or pignoli. For optional extra flavor, toast them in a dry skillet until golden brown before serving.\nMake sure to cook the leeks, potatoes, and asparagus until very tender so that it easily purees with the immersion blender. This will prevent stringy soup.\nStorage: Cool completely, then store in an air-tight container in the fridge for 3-5 days.\u00a0\nFreezing: Cool completely, then store in an air-tight container and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge or at room temperature, then reheat it on the stove or in the microwave.\u00a0\n"

Use pears, peaches, or bananas.\nInstead of pecans, use almonds or walnuts\nFor a gluten-free option, use a 1:1 gluten-free baking flour.\nStore the leftovers in an airtight container for up to four days. Freeze the muffins in a freezer-safe container or bag for up to six months. When ready to enjoy the muffins, allow them to thaw in the refrigerator overnight prior to eating.\nServe these muffins warm with your favorite vegan or regular butter.\n"

Cut the tomatoes in half and thinly slice the basil and onion.Once the pasta is done, drain well in a colander and run under cold water to stop the cooking process.Add the pasta and chopped veggies to a large serving bowl. Pour the vinaigrette dressing and add mozzarella balls.Using a wooden spoon mix well until pasta and veggies are fully coated into the super delicious dressing!Refrigerate for 20 minutes before serving or you may serve immediately.",
            "notes": "\nPasta: Use any Pasta you have handy, wheat, white, lentil, or gluten-free.\nOil: It is best to use olive oil, but you may sub with avocado oil if you don\u2019t have olive oil.\nTomatoes: Use Cherry tomatoes if possible, because they tend to be sweet and crispy. Of course, you may chop up any other tomatoes you have but try to stick to grapevine tomatoes\nBasil: Fresh would be ideal for the flavor of a Caprese salad, but if you don\u2019t have any you may use dried basil leaves.\nVinegar: Balsamic is a must, whether you use regular, aged, or glazed.\nCheese: We really recommend mozzarella. If you don\u2019t have the balls and have fresh mozzarella that you can chop would be best.\n"

You may use boneless chicken thighs which will be much tender meat but the calories will vary.\nWant to use beef instead of chicken, you can. Go for lean cuts of beef.\nUse low sodium soy sauce or you can swap it for coconut aminos.\nGarlic and ginger: For the best taste and flavor, use fresh garlic and ginger. If you need to work with what you have at home, use 2 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp ginger.\nHoney: we love using honey but you may use maple syrup. The taste will vary slightly.\nNutrition facts do not include the rice.\n"

Pour the oil mixture over the top and generously rub all over the potatoes to evenly coat.Now spread the wedges onto the prepared baking sheets, making sure you leave some space in between.Sprinkle with 3/4 of the parmesan and bake for 30-35 minutes, flipping once with a tong to ensure even browning.Once done, remove from the oven. sprinkle with remaining parmesan cheese on top and garnish with freshly chopped parsley.Season with extra salt and pepper, if needed, and serve warm with your favorite dip.

Using water will change the flavor slightly\nParmesan cheese: we love using parmesan cheese, but you may use light fat cream cheese or any other crumbly cheese like Romano Cheese.\nSpinach: always best to use fresh baby spinach. But if in a pinch you may use frozen spinach, thaw, and drain before use.\n"

Season with a generous pinch of salt and bring the water to a boil, over medium-high heat.Boil for 15 minutes or until potatoes and carrots are easily pierced with a paring knife.Meanwhile, add a steamer basket under another pot filled with about 1 cup water (or use the same pot where the veggies are boiling if the water doesn't touch the steamer) Steam the broccoli for 3-4 minutes, or just until fork-tender.Once the veggies are done, remove from the heat and place in a colander to drain, reserving about 1 cup of water from the veggies.

Choose your favorite.\nShallots: If you don\u2019t have shallots, substitute with sweet onion or red onion.\nChoosing potatoes: Try to choose small, evenly sized potatoes.

Add the onion and garlic, saute for 3-5 minutes until the onions turn translucent.Add in the spices; paprika, coriander, garam masala, salt, and turmeric powder. Saute for a minute.Stir in the tomato sauce and cook for a couple of minutes. Once the sauce is thickened add the coconut milk and cook for 5 minutes.Once the tikka masala starts bubbling add the chicken back to the pot and allow the masala to simmer for 10 minutes on a low flame.Once the chicken is cooked through add in the chopped cilantro and turn off the heat.Serve the creamy chicken tikka masala with a bowl of rice to enjoy!",

Add extra chocolate chips now on top of the cookie dough balls if desired.Bake for 12-14 minutes or until edges is golden brown. Let cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to continue cooling",
            "notes": "\nMake sure your butter and eggs are at room temp. This means they'll incorporate into the dough better.\nYou can swap the butter out for ghee.\nIf the cookies don\u2019t drop into cookie shapes in the oven within the first 5 minutes, you can easily press them down with fork midway through cooking.\n\u00a0If you are not using 100% pure erythritol, your cookies will not flatten completely.\nIdeally use a good quality, grass-fed, butter. Grass-fed butter contains up to 6 times more CLA which can help your body burn fat properly.\nUse a wire rack to help the cookies cool properly, so they won't have a soggy base.\nYou can swap the chocolate chips for walnuts\u00a0if you like.\nYou can omit the sea salt if you wish, but it does add a lovely flavor profile.\nThese Keto Cookies are done when the edges are starting to brown. They will still be lovely and soft on the inside!\nIf you want crispier Keto Cookies, bake them for a little bit longer. Remove from the oven when the edges go a little darker brown.\n"

Macaroni, ziti, and rigatoni are all perfect for this chicken carbonara recipe. You could even try it with fettuccine, linguine, or spaghetti!\nMake it gluten-free: All you have to do is swap the penne for a gluten-free substitute.\nMake it vegetarian: If you\u2019d like to make a vegetarian carbonara instead, skip the chicken or use a meat-free substitute, and add vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.\nAdd a little spice! Sprinkle a pinch or two of red pepper flakes if you enjoy a little heat.\nToss in some more veggies! Corn and diced red or yellow peppers are delicious in pasta carbonara.\nStore any leftover chicken carbonara in the fridge for up to 4 days.\nReheat in the microwave or in the oven covered with aluminum foil until piping hot.\n"

Use your favorite kitchen thermometer for checking the temperature.\n"

Shrimp would be another great option.\nYou can make this pasts dish much healthier by using whole-grain pasta, lentil pasta, or zome zucchini noodles.\nFresh spinach is prefered. But you may use frozen if you have to. If you go with frozen, make sure you thaw first and drain.\nStore leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.\n"

Just before cooking it, remove from the fridge and allow it to sit over the counter for 20 minutes to reach room temp.Preheat an outdoor grill or a grill pan over medium heat. Grill the chicken breast until nicely charred and cooked through, for around 12-14 minutes.Meanwhile, in a large salad bowl add all the salad ingredients.Once the chicken is done cooking, place it on a chopping board and allow it to sit until ready to handle. Slice and add it to the salad bowl.Drizzle the salad with the remaining marinade from the jar. Toss to combine and serve.",

Kale or arugula will also work just fine.\nVegetables: You can absolutely add other vegetables to the mix, some suggestions included grilled veggies such as asparagus, zucchini, or bell peppers. Marinated artichoke hearts or black olives are also a nice addition.\nCheese: A sprinkle of cheese on top is so tasty. We recommend shredded Mexican cheese or cheddar.\n"

            "notes": "\nUse extra virgin if possible. I prefer using olive oil over other types of oils for this recipe. There are so many health benefits of olive oil. They are rich in healthy Monounsaturated Fats and high in antioxidants.\nIt would be best if you use fresh lemons for this Greek pasta salad dressing. Nothing beats the robust flavors of fresh lemons. If you happen to only have bottled lemon juice then use bottled lemon juice. I highly recommend using fresh lemon juice.\nYou can use lime if you have that instead, it gives you more of a tang.\nIf you don\u2019t have red wine vinegar you have a few other options you can use. You may try to substitute with white\u00a0wine vinegar, apple cider\u00a0vinegar, or balsamic vinegar. Vinegar is essential for traditional greek dressing.\nUse dried or fresh herbs. Traditional Greek salad dressing calls for oregano.\nGarlic will bring out the flavor of the dressing. If you don\u2019t have any fresh garlic you can about 1 teaspoon garlic powder.\nUse salt and pepper sparingly. You can either add some to the dressing say about 1/2 a teaspoon each and then taste the salad later to see if it needs more salt and pepper and go ahead and adjust accordingly.\nSwap the pasta for something like spinach tortellini, to make it a\u00a0Greek Tortellini Salad.\nAdd a protein to make it even heartier, grilled chicken works great.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNutritional facts:\nPlease keep in mind that the nutritional information is calculated using a nutrition facts calculator.

Warm rice or glutinous short rice will make this recipe mushy! The perfect way to use up some of your leftover rice.\nScrambling the eggs away from the vegetables is essential. They firm up the best when they are not immediately mixed in with the other ingredients.\nUse pre-minced fresh garlic and ginger to make this recipe even easier!\nUse up any leftover vegetables in the fridge. This is a delicious way to clear out the fridge before a grocery shop.\nStore leftovers in the fridge for up to 3 days.\nThis is great for meal prep!\n"

Or reheat in the microwave.\u00a0",
            "notes": "\nUse a preheated waffle iron.\nUse room temperature eggs! They turn out lighter and fluffier if you do\nTry not to overfill the waffle iron, it's best to slightly under-fill it because the batter will spread out when the waffle iron is closed.\nDon't open the waffle iron until it's ready! Opening the waffle iron will lower the temperature and extend the cooking time.\nIf you have a non-stick waffle iron, use a silicone or wooden utensil, so it won't scratch the surface.\nAvoid violent overmixing of the batter. The paleo waffle batter should be smooth but not mixed too hard, as this results in chewier/less fluffy waffles.\nYou can reheat the waffles in the toaster or the microwave.\nFor the meal prep containers, peel the eggs in advance if you like.\n"

You may use ground turkey if you prefer but the taste and texture will change slightly since the turkey tends to be more on the dry side.\nDon\u2019t like chicken or turkey, make beef kafta instead. Here is our popular beef kafta recipe you can try instead.\nUse fresh ingredients where possible. It is important to use fresh parsley as that\u2019s what brings out the kafta flavor. You may use dried mint if you cant get your hands on fresh mint.\nYou can easily sub the whole wheat bread for breadcrumbs. If your ground chicken is not too lean then you can cut back on the breadcrumbs and use only half the amount.\nEgg and breadcrumbs are important ingredients to act as binders so the whole kebab doesn\u2019t fall apart off the skewer are you grill them.\nWet your hands with water or oil when adding the chicken kafta to the skewers. This is because it might be a bit sticky and it just makes things easier.\nDo place the chicken kafta in the fridge for a few minutes before adding to the skewers. It makes everything bind together so well.\n"

It burns easily and will give the sauce a bitter taste.\u00a0\nStoring: Store in a container in the fridge for up to five days. Freeze for up to 4-6 months.\nSlow cooker instructions: Follow the instructions until the meat is cooked and the tomatoes and other seasonings are added. Transfer sauce to the slow cooker and cook on low for 3-5 hours, stirring occasionally. Serve over cooked pasta.\u00a0\n"

            "notes": "\nYou can prep these 30 mins in advance or overnight.\nAdding almond butter or peanut butter makes these oats even creamier and gives a nutty/savory twist to the flavor.\nDo not use quick oats as they will get too soggy when soaked with milk. Also, do not use steel-cut oats because they won\u2019t soften enough to eat with milk. Stick with plain old fashioned oats for the best results.\nIf you prefer a looser consistency to your overnight oatmeal recipe, add a little more milk.\nAdd your toppings just before serving. Toppings can not only prevent the soaking process from happening but throw off the liquid to oat ratio, leaving you with soggy oats!\nTo make gluten-free use gluten-free oats.\nTo make dairy-free use a dairy-free milk option, almond milk works great.\n"

Just about 5 minutes will do.\nIf using raw shrimps, you must time the soak time for 15 minutes to allow it to cook in the acidity of the lemon and lime juice.\nChop your onions well! You just want a hint of spicy raw onion, not a mouthful of it. Using a mandoline to thinly slice the red onion is great.\nDon\u2019t skimp on the cilantro.\u00a0Just like guacamole, ceviche needs a good helping of cilantro to balance the flavors.\nAdd a spicy kick. Adding a few drops of Tabasco (or any other favorite hot sauce) will give your ceviche just the right amount of kick. It also adds flavor from the vinegar and spices.\nRemoving the ribs and seeds from your jalapeno will significantly reduce the heat of the pepper. If you prefer spicy food, keep some of the seeds and ribs in the pepper when you dice it up.\nAdd orange for a subtle but satisfying twist. Adding a little orange juice or lemon juice in addition to the lime adds a nice, subtle flavor that compliments the lime. Orange juice also adds a perfect little sweetness that can stand up to the spice.\nYou can substitute part of the shrimp with pieces of firm white fish, bay scallops, or even sliced octopus.\n"

Reserve any loose florets to cook with the steaks or for another recipe.Brush the cauliflower steaks generously with Chimichurri sauce on both sides. Reserve some of the sauce for later.Heat a grill or a grill pan to medium. Place the cauliflowers onto the grill and cook until tender and charred in spots, about 5-7 minutes per side.Serve cauliflower steaks with extra Chimichurri and enjoy!",
            "notes": "\nMake sure to use a preheated grill or oven.\nChoose large cauliflowers.\nOne head of cauliflower will yield 4 thin or 2 thicker steaks, depending upon the size of your cauliflower, so if you are cooking for a group, adjust accordingly.\nIf you slice your cauliflower steaks too thin they may fall apart when flipping, so be careful when slicing not to go too thin!\nYou may have some leftover florets, just toss them on the grill too!\nAllow the chimichurri sauce to sit for at least 15 mins, this enhances the flavor.\nThe ultimate cooking time depends on how thick you cut the steaks, and on your particular grill.\nYou can cook these on the grill or in the oven.\nCauliflower steaks can be cut up to 8 hours ahead of time.\nChimichurri sauce used in this recipe. You can also use pesto or just a simple garlic herb sauce.\n\n\u00a0\nNutritional facts:\nPlease keep in mind that the nutritional information is calculated using a nutrition facts calculator.

These allow the milk to be absorbed better, giving you smooth mashed potatoes.\nInvest in a ricer for restaurant-quality mash. Running the potatoes through a ricer before mashing will give you that velvety smooth consistency!\nTop with herbs and chopped green onion.\n"

Stir in the juice of 1 lime, and season with salt and pepper to your taste.Once the shrimp skewers are done, set aside on a plate.Keeping the grill pan over medium-high heat place the corn over and grill until charred on all sides, flipping it frequently, for about 6-8 minutes in total.Allow the corn to chill until ready to handle, then using a sharp knife, slice the corn from the cob and add it to the avocado salad.Toss the salad to combine one more time, then top with shrimp skewers and serve.",

Spread the wedges on a baking sheet, drizzle them with a touch more oil, and bake them at 450 degrees for 5-6 minutes or until crispy. I wouldn\u2019t recommend the microwave as it tends to make them even softer. Alternatively,\u00a0you can also reheat them on the stovetop.

Place on the prepared large sheet pan. Repeat with all the remaining asparagus spears. Use 2 baking sheets if needed, to avoid overcrowding them.Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until a crispy golden crust develops.",

So for the Cheese Board, you can add some fresh herbs like Rosemary or cranberries.\nMake sure the Cheese Board is full of a variety to choose from and make it presentable.

They really add a beautiful look to this little and delicious cake.\nCut your butter into pieces before browning it. This makes sure it cooks evenly.\nWhen browning the butter, keep stirring, this stops the butter from burning and also helps to cook it evenly.\nUse a light colored pan when browning butter, then you spot exactly when the butter\u00a0has\u00a0browned\nMake sure your eggs are at room temperature. Room temperature ingredients mix more thoroughly into the batter.\nDon't forget to prep you cake tin! A generous coating of butter or non stick spray means the madeleines come out more easily.\nFor an extra decadent touch, dip the Gluten Free Madeleines in some melted gluten free chocolate!\nAllow to cool before dusting.\n"

Bake for 8-10 minutes.Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to continue cooling.",
            "notes": "For best results use a kitchen scale to measure ingredients if you have on, otherwise be sure to use the proper method as listed for measuring.\nKeep your dough at room temp. Cold dough spreads less because it takes more time for the butter to melt. As a result, the dough will set before the butter is completely melted. When baking crinkle cookies, you want the dough to spread.\nThis recipe makes a big batch so feel free to freeze or store in an airtight container."

Enough just to have a pocket to fill with all the good stuff. Rub the chicken with salt, pepper, and Italian herbs outside and inside the pocket.Stuff it with one slice of mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes, and spinach. Seal each chicken breast with a toothpick.Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pan. Sear the chicken on both sides for 5-6 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Set aside on a plate and cover to keep warm.Meanwhile, in a small bowl whisk the cornstarch with almond milk until it is fully combined.Add 1 teaspoon of olive oil to the same preheated pan and cook the garlic for 1 minute. Add the Italian herbs together with the chicken broth, stirring well to deglaze the pan.Add the almond milk mixture together with the parmesan cheese. Stir to combine and allow the sauce to simmer for a couple of minutes, just until it starts to thicken. Add in the olives and return the chicken to the pan into the creamy sauce.Reduce the heat to low and cover with a lid. Let the chicken simmer into the sauce for 10-12 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked.Garnish with fresh chopped parsley!",

But if in a pinch, you can use 1 tablespoon of garlic powder.\nin place of chicken broth, you may use vegetable broth\nuse freshly grated parmesan cheese if possible.\nother cheeses to use in place of mozzarella are provolone, white cheddar, gouda, swiss, or Romano.\n"

Slice the cucumber halfway lengthwise. Using a spoon, scoop out the seeds avoiding the flesh and chop. Slice the radish and finely chop the green onions.Chop the eggs into bite-size pieces. Once the potatoes are done, remove from the heat and allow them to cool for about 10-15 minutes.Chop them into 1/4-inch thick rounds and place them into a large bowl. Add cucumber, radish, green onions, eggs and a generous pinch of salt to the potatoes.Pour the dressing all over the veggies. Mix well to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with cling film, and refrigerate to enhance the flavors for at least 15 minutes.Sprinkle some more black pepper and enjoy.",

The key is to blend in a food processor.\nIf you don\u2019t have a food processor, 1 cup of rolled oats blended will yield just about 1 cup of oat flour or any other flour. If using flour start with 1 and 1/4th cup of four and if needed add another 1/4 cup.\nTo make this vegan-friendly, use any non-dairy milk, and egg substitutes. For every one whole egg, you will need 1/4 cup of egg substitute. Also, top with a non-dairy yogurt.\nDon\u2019t have any of the spices mentioned? you can sub with 1 tsp of pumpkin spice.\nWrap and save the remaining pancakes in the fridge for up to 4 days.\nFor a gluten-free option, use appropriate gluten-free flour and oats options.\n"

But other options that you may consider with ingredients you already have at home are flaxseed, yogurt, buttermilk, silken tofu, applesauce. replace 1 egg with 1/4 cup of all the above. If you are replacing it with flaxseed, mix 1 tablespoon of flaxseed with 3 tablespoons of water.\nMilk: Any milk will work in this recipe.\nNut butter: We used peanut butter, but you can use any nut butter like almond butter or cashew butter.\nSweetener: We used maple syrup, but you can use honey or agave. If you want to use coconut sugar or monk fruit sweetener it\u2019s fine too.\n\nStorage:\nIf you don\u2019t get to finish this you can simply cover it and store it in the fridge for up to 3 days.

Pour your batter into a zipped-top bag, then cut the corner off and pipe it into the donut pan.\nTo check the doneness of these baked donuts, poke your finger into the top of one. If the donut bounces back, they are done.\nYou can add some ground nutmeg to the topping for more festive flavors.\n"

Add the beaten yolks to the wet ingredients of your batter. Then, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold the eggs whites gently into the final batter using a spatula.\nDon't Lift The Lid Too Early. If you lift to peek at the waffles too early you may rip them. Wait until the light goes off. If your waffle maker doesn't have a doneness indicator, watch the steam coming out of the unit as you cook.\nServing Waffles At The Same Time. Unless you have half a dozen waffle makers, you'll find it hard to serve them all at the same time! Make your waffles and store them in the oven to 250 degrees. A short time in the oven also helps a crispiness!"

Season with salt and pepper to taste, then mix until well combined.Remove the chicken breast from the refrigerator and stuff each breast with the cheese mixture. Secure the pockets with a toothpick, if needed.Place the stuffed breast into the prepared dish and bake for 25 minutes until chicken is nicely golden brown, flipping halfway through to ensure even browning.

In a large mixing bowl, combine ground meat, green onions, 1 cup panko, beaten eggs, and 1/3 cup of hot sauce.Add onion powder, garlic powder, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Using your clean hands, mix the meat until all the ingredients are incorporated and distributed evenly throughout the meat.You can also use a large wooden spoon or a spatula to mix. Now rub your hands with some oil and pinch off a piece of meat mixture (about 1tablespoon). Gently roll the meat between your palms to form 1-1/2-inch meatballs.Dip the meatballs into the remaining panko breadcrumbs, gently pressing to coat on all sides.Place the meatballs into the prepared baking tray and lightly spray with cooking oil spray. Bake for 12 minutes until nicely golden brown.Remove from the oven and pour the remaining hot sauce on top. Toss to coat evenly, place the dish back into the oven and bake for an additional 5-6 minutes, or until cooked through.Serve the buffalo balls with the blue cheese dip and your favorite veggie sticks. Enjoy!",

This is when the grains will be most firm and rice-like. It's best to make it no more than a day or two ahead of time.\nA good-sized cast iron, stainless steel or non-stick skillets are your best choices for this cauliflower rice. Avoid a saucepan, they are too deep and the cauliflower rice doesn\u2019t cook through as quickly or evenly.\n"

Go for vegetable oil, avocado oil, or grapeseed oil.\nThis tomato soup can easily be made in your instant pot or slow cooker.\n\nStorage:\nPlace leftovers in a container and store in the fridge for up to 5-7 days.

Add onion and saut\u00e9 for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add mushrooms and garlic, cook, until mushrooms are slightly golden brown.Meanwhile, whisk cornstarch and 1/4 cup milk to a bowl and set aside.Reduce the heat to a low and pour the stock and remaining 1 1/4 cup of milk into the pan. Add mustard, salt, and pepper, mix well to combine. Cook until the mixture starts to simmer.Pour in the prepared cornstarch and milk mixture, mixing thoroughly until sauce is thickened.Take off the heat and stir in 1 cup of the shredded cheese. Taste and adjust the salt and pepper according to your taste.In a baking dish, add the cooked pasta, broccoli, and diced chicken. Pour over the mushroom sauce, and stir to nicely coat all the ingredients.Smooth the top with the back of a spoon and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, until cheese on top, is bubbly and golden.Serve warm and enjoy!",

It\u2019s fresher this way and you have control over how big you want your florets.\nStir your pasta as soon as you drop it in the water, this prevents the pasta from sticking.\nCook your pasta a minute short of al dente, this will make sure your pasta isn\u2019t too mushy after baking.\nYou can use any fat content milk you\u2019d like to make this dish rich and creamy, or lighter.\nIdeally, shred your own cheddar, pre-shredded cheddar never melts that well.\nAdd a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, for a touch of heat, if you like.\nAdd a dash of nutmeg for a touch of warming winter flavor.\n"

Cover and refrigerate until baking. An extra 5-10 minutes may need to be added to the bake time, if it\u2019s cold from the fridge.\nFreezing: If you plan to freeze this, we recommend undercooking the pasta a bit. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and then again with foil.\u00a0Freeze\u00a0for up to 3 months. When you\u2019re ready to enjoy, thaw in the fridge, remove plastic wrap and bake according to directions.\n"

You can even just eat the salad as it is. It\u2019s so fresh and crisp!\nStore\u00a0any leftover chicken salad in an airtight container for 3-5 days in the fridge.\nWe don\u2019t recommend freezing chicken salad.\u00a0It can separate when it thaws and becomes watery, losing its creamy texture and taste. However, you can freeze the cooked chicken, then just defrost it in the refrigerator the day before you want to make the salad, and add the other fresh ingredients just before serving.\n"

Allow it to bubble for a couple of seconds to thicken up the sauce and wilt the spinach.Once the sauce coats the back of a spoon, stir in the cooked pasta and sliced chicken.Sprinkle with chopped parsley and freshly ground black pepper and serve immediately!",
            "notes": "\nServing size: one bowl or 2 cups\u00a0\nChicken: You can use chicken thighs if you would like. They may take a little longer to cook and the nutritional profile may be a bit different as chicken breasts are leaner. Consider using Rotisserie chicken.\nPasta: Don\u2019t overcook the pasta. Cook until al dente. Do not rinse the pasta. Consider using lentil or chickpea pasta for an even healthier option.\nGluten-free: To make this recipe completely gluten-free, substitute with gluten-free pasta.\nGarlic: For the freshest flavor, we like to use fresh garlic cloves, but garlic powder will work if in a pinch.\nSpinach: We used fresh spinach but you may use frozen.\nMilk: 2% milk works great but if you prefer using dairy-free milk go right ahead.\nGrate your own cheese for the best flavor if possible.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0"

You can also slice the avocado into \u201cfries\u201d before scooping the flesh out.\nDo not use avocados that are too ripe. They need to be firm to the touch.\nAllow the avocado fries to cool before eating them. They will be hot inside!\nYou can serve these as an appetizer, side dish, snack, or (my favorite) as tacos in a tortilla topped with cheese, salsa, cilantro, and sour cream. They make the best tacos!\n"

Tapioca starch can also work.\nFresh ginger and garlic will add extra bold flavors.\nInstant Pot Directions: Follow the directions as you would for the stovetop, but use the Saut\u00e9 function on the IP. Add the chicken to the pressure cooker once hot. You will follow the exact cooking time and everything!\nBake this spicy and sweet Asian chicken breast in the oven at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for fifteen to eighteen minutes. The skin on the chicken will be crispy! Chicken thighs will take longer to cook. Make sure the internal temperature is 165 degrees Fahrenheit with a meat thermometer.\nFor a vegetarian version, use tofu instead of chicken.

            "notes": "\nNOTE: *****To make this dish healthier we used almond milk. But you can use any other milk, heavy cream, or whipping cream if you don\u2019t mind it. Also, be careful not to use sweetened almond milk!!!!****\nPasta: use pasta of choice. Gluten-free, whole wheat, lentil pasta, or chickpea pasta.\nChicken: we used chicken breast but you may use boneless thighs. Consider using shrimp instead of chicken if desired.\nSpinach: we recommend using fresh spinach. Frozen spinach can be used but thaw first and drain to remove excess water.\nUse fresh garlic or replace it with 1 tablespoon of garlic powder.\nCook the pasta al dente since it will cook again with everything else to prevent having soft and soggy pasta.\nStore leftover chicken pasta in a container and store it in the fridge for up to 3 days.\n"

For achieving the perfect creamy consistency, you're going to want to invest in a good food processor or blender.\nAvoid bottled lemon juice, use freshly squeezed lemon juice to lend your blend that freshness and zest.\nAdd an avocado, great for guac lovers! Simply add fiber-filled avocado chunks with cilantro and a few dashes of cumin while the hummus is blending, and watch how the texture turns even smoother and richer.\n"

Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add rice and broth, season with some salt and add the remaining tablespoon of oil.Stir well and cook uncovered for 15 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. Allow it to chill until veggies are done.Spread the cooked rice onto the tray with roasted veggies and sprinkle with cranberries. Mix well to combine.Taste and season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Sprinkle generously with fresh chopped parsley.",
            "notes": "For storage:\n\nYou can store it covered in your refrigerator for up to 2 days, just heat through when ready to serve.\nUse a\u00a0wild rice blend that includes several varieties of rice. This allows the dish to have a texture balance of fluffiness, tenderness, and a slight chewiness.\nSince there are different brands of wild rice blends, be sure to cook according to your package instructions, veering towards the tender side. If the rice seems a bit too firm after cooking, mix in just enough extra broth to moisten all the rice, and cover/simmer 10 more minutes or until tender but not overly cooked.\nAdd some freshly shaved brussels sprouts in this rice pilaf recipe; you can use a bag of pre-shaved fresh brussels sprouts if your grocery store carries it. If not, it\u2019s simple to slice your own.\n\u00a0If reheating after a night in the fridge, sprinkle with a bit of broth evenly over the top just prior to reheating, which ensures that rice stays moist.\n"

If it has to be made ahead, prior to serving just reheat in microwave or oven for a few minutes and serve.\nTo steam the brussel sprouts either use a bamboo steamer or your preferred choice of steaming\nIf you don't have a steamer, steam the Brussel Sprouts in boiling water for 4-5 minutes until fork tender. Discard the water. This is what you refer to as blanching.\n\nIf using a bamboo steamer, place the bamboo steamer into a wide-rimmed, shallow pan or skillet, and fill it with enough water to come up above the bottom rim of the steamer by about a quarter inch. For easy cleaning, line the steamer with parchment paper.\nAdd in the sprouts, and cover with the lid. Steam over high heat until almost tender, about 5-6 minutes.\u00a0\n\nFor a crunchy brussel sprout recipe, skip steaming and follow the directions\n"

If you do have leftovers, you can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. You may reheat it in the microwave. If you prefer to reheat in a toaster oven, make sure you wrap up the chicken in foil to prevent them from drying out.\nMarinade: The longer you marinate the chicken shish Tawook the better. At the very minimum, you should marinate for 30 minutes to 4 hours. If you can make it the night before and allow it to marinate in the fridge overnight that would be ideal.\nNutrition Facts: We use a computerized system to calculate the nutritional values.

            "notes": "\nSeason with your favorite seasonings! Some that would taste amazing on these avocado fries are cajun or creole seasoning, chili powder, hot paprika, taco seasoning, and Old Bay seasoning.\nThe easiest way to remove avocado from its peel is to slice it in half around its seed, and then take a large spoon and scoop the flesh out around the edges keeping it in one piece. You can also slice the avocado into \u201cfries\u201d before scooping the flesh out.\nDo not use avocados that are too ripe. They need to be firm to the touch.\nAllow the avocado fries to cool before eating them. They will be hot inside!\nYou can serve these as an appetizer, side dish, snack, or (my favorite) as tacos in a tortilla topped with cheese, salsa, cilantro, and sour cream. They make the best tacos!\n"

Wholesome, organic ingredients will result in a tastier, healthier hummus.\n\u00a0Top off your dip with sliced pickles for a satisfying crunch.\nFor a creamier hummus, tenderize the chickpeas using baking soda in the overnight soaking of the chickpeas,\nInvest in some good tahini like Soom or Al Arz, it's worth it!\n"

I like to prep everything the evening or morning before to allow all of the flavors to develop in both the meat and the salsa.\nMake double and freeze half. This is a great hack if you are a busy household! I make double and freeze the jerk chicken recipe in the ziplock bag while it marinates. Then I can use it up to 3 months later. Just thaw it overnight until it\u2019s completely defrosted and cook!\n"

            "notes": "\nUse a preheated oven.\nTo make vegan, swap the whey protein with vegan protein.\nAllow the cookies to cool before glazing, otherwise, the glaze will not harden.\nFor this recipe use pure canned pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling. Pumpkin pie filling is loaded with other ingredients and flavorings, that'll also change the flavor of these healthy pumpkin cookies.\nIdeally use a cookie scoop to portion out the cookie dough.\nSprinkle a touch of pumpkin spice onto the finished glazed cookies for an extra spice hit!\nDon\u2019t overbake the cookies. You want these Healthy Pumpkin Cookies nice and soft, not dry. When you pull them out of the oven, they will look slightly underbaked but will continue to bake on the cookie sheet for a couple more minutes- perfect!\nTo measure your flour accurately, spoon the flour into the measuring cup until it's overfilled. Then, use the back of a butter knife to push off the excess flour.\n"

Gently fold to fully combine.Stir in 3/4 cup of the blueberries and fold again.Now pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish, using a spatula or the back of a spoon, hard-pack the mixture to create an even smooth top. Add the rest of the blueberrues on top. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the topping smells toasty and looks golden brown.Place the pan on a wire rack to cool completely.Divide into 6 squares, garnish with the remaining fresh berries on top, and serve with plain yogurt.",

Depending on your oven it may need to bake 5-10 mins longer than the suggested time.\nCinnamon added in the video (optional)\nFeel free to different kinds of fruit, loads of possibilities!\nAllow it to cool off completely so it thickens. Let it sit for 15 minutes before serving.\nMake gluten-free by using gluten-free oats.\nBe sure to have the liquid ingredients at room temp before mixing. Room temperature ingredients will blend better.\nDon\u2019t substitute instant oats, as it will turn out mushy!\nIf you don\u2019t have fresh, you can use frozen blueberries \u2013 no need to defrost.\nServe with a dollop of plain yogurt or Greek yogurt.\nDouble up for a bigger crowd! This recipe can easily be doubled if you have an influx of guests!\n"

Pat the fillets with paper towel to remove any excess moisture.\nCooking times may vary depending on the thickness of your fillet.\nUse a non stick, flat pan to cook the salmon. The fish is more likely to stick on cast iron and stainless steel pans.\nIf you are using an instant read thermometer, it should register at 145\u00baF.\nTake care not to overcook the salmon. When over cooked it can become dry and chewy.\n"
